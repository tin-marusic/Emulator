Hi Ante,

I attached the updated tower-module mapping file. The files with "CE-H" prefix now include scintillators. Since the LpGBT link mapping is also updated, the "CE-E" files have also changed. 

So I suppose your existing code should work with the new files given that I used the same format. You may or may not need to change one thing depending on how your algorithm works. There are new tower names in the CE-H file, for example in these lines:
had-eta-2-phi2 0
had-eta-1-phi2 2 72 2 84 2
had-eta-2-phi3 0
had-eta-1-phi3 2 72 2 84 2
had-eta-2-phi4 0
had-eta-1-phi4 0

These are towers that exist in scintillators but not in silicons (2 eta bins in the inner side of the HGCal). I named their eta value as -2 and -1; so now instead of eta0, eta1, eta2,... in the tower names, we have eta-2, eta-1, eta0, eta1, eta2,... . So you should just make sure the algorithm handles the minus signs for eta, if needed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Mohammad

You can ignore the next few lines. I just added them for the record so that I would be able to find them later.
- Silicons split to 1/8s
- Scintillators split to 1/16s
- LpGBT link mapping from Samuel: chi2 includes the number of towers (silicon-only) and number of modules
